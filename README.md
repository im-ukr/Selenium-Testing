# Selenium-Testing

The provided code snippets demonstrate how to use Selenium WebDriver to automate interactions with a web page. Each snippet targets a specific functionality on the page and shows how to interact with elements such as text fields, buttons, and checkboxes.

Login Process Automation:
This code automates the login process by entering a username and password, and then clicking the login button. It waits for the login process to complete and checks if the login was successful by verifying the presence of a "Logout" button.
Product Addition to Cart Automation:
This code automates the process of adding a product to the cart. It enters a product name (or leaves it empty) and clicks the "Add to Cart" button. It then checks if the product was successfully added to the cart based on the presence of the product name in the page source.
Checkout Process Automation:
This code automates the checkout process by entering an address, payment mode, and amount. It then clicks the "Checkout" button and checks if all fields are filled before proceeding with the checkout.
Logout Automation:
This code automates the logout process by clicking the "Logout" button. It checks if the logout was successful by verifying the presence of the login form elements (username, password, and login button).
Each script demonstrates basic interactions with web elements using Selenium WebDriver and showcases how to handle different scenarios such as successful and failed actions.
